CSS selectors are used to target and style HTML elements. Key types include:

- Basic Selectors: Target elements by type (p), class (.class), or ID (#id).
- Grouping Selectors: Apply the same style to multiple elements (h1, h2, h3).
- Attribute Selectors: Target elements based on attributes ([type="text"], [title*="info"]).
- Pseudo-classes: Style elements based on their state (:hover, :first-child, :nth-child(n)).
- Pseudo-elements: Insert content before or after elements (::before, ::after).
- Combinators: Select elements based on their relationship (div p, ul > li, h1 + p, h1 ~ p).

These selectors help precisely define styles for various elements on a web page...
